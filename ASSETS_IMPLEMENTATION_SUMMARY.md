## 🔧 **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION**

### **Asset Accessibility:**

### **Code Changes Made:**

#### **Enhanced Audio System (`wheel.js`):**

// Added audio elements for asset sounds
this.audioElements = {
    spinSound: new Audio('sounds/spin-sound.mp3'),
    winSound: new Audio('sounds/win-sound.mp3'),
    rareWinSound: new Audio('sounds/rare-win-sound.mp3')
};

// New sound methods
playSpinSound() - Plays when wheel starts spinning
playWinSound(category) - Plays celebration sound based on prize category
stopAllSounds() - Stops all audio when sound is disabled
```

#### **Integration Points:**
1. **Spin Start:** `playSpinSound()` called when user clicks spin button
2. **Prize Celebration:** `playWinSound(prize.category)` called when popup displays
3. **Sound Control:** Enhanced sound toggle to control all audio elements
