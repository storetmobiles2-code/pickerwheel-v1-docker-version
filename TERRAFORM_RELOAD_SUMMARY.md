- Regenerated 71 daily CSV files (2025-09-21 to 2025-11-30)

### 4. **Verification Results**

```
📊 Database Status:
   ✅ Total items: 21 (matches itemlist_dates.txt)
   ✅ Available today: 9 (always-available items)
   ✅ Date-specific: 12 (quantity=0 until their date)

🎡 Wheel Display:
   ✅ Shows all 21 items
   ✅ 9 items with quantity > 0 (can be won today)
   ✅ 12 items with quantity = 0 (visible but not winnable until their date)

📋 Admin Panel:
   ✅ Total items: 21
   ✅ Available: 9
   ✅ Out of stock: 12 (will become available on their dates)
```

## 🎯 How It Works (Terraform-Like Behavior)

### Always-Available Items (`*` in dates):
- **Always visible** on the wheel
- **Always winnable** (quantity > 0 every day)
- Example: "luggage bag" - can be won any day

### Date-Specific Items:
- **Always visible** on the wheel (all 21 items show)
- **Only winnable on their specific date**
- Before their date: quantity = 0 (visible but grayed out/not selectable)
- On their date: quantity > 0 (visible and winnable)
- After their date: quantity = 0 again

### Example:
```
Item: REFRIGERATOR
Date: 2025-10-28

Before Oct 28:
  - Visible on wheel ✅
  - Quantity = 0 ❌
  - Not winnable ❌

On Oct 28:
  - Visible on wheel ✅
  - Quantity = 1 ✅
  - Winnable! ✅

After Oct 28:
  - Visible on wheel ✅
  - Quantity = 0 ❌
  - Not winnable ❌
```

## 🔧 Terraform-Style Management

### Adding a New Item:
1. Add line to `itemlist_dates.txt`:
   ```
   NEW ITEM,Common,5,2,*
   ```
2. Restart Docker: `docker-compose restart`
3. Item automatically added to database ✅

### Removing an Item:
1. Remove line from `itemlist_dates.txt`
2. **Wipe database**: `rm -f backend/pickerwheel_contest.db`
3. Restart Docker: `docker-compose restart`
4. Item removed from database ✅

### Changing Item Properties:
1. Update line in `itemlist_dates.txt`
2. **Wipe database** (to avoid old data conflicts)
3. Restart Docker
4. Changes applied ✅

**Note:** For property changes, wiping the database is recommended to ensure consistency. For adding new items, just restart is enough.

## 📂 Files Modified

1. **`itemlist_dates.txt`** - Master configuration (21 items)
2. **`itemlist_dates_v2.txt`** - Synchronized copy
3. **`daily_csvs/prizes_*.csv`** - 71 files regenerated
4. **`backend/pickerwheel_contest.db`** - Completely recreated

---

## ✅ Current State

```
Database: ✅ Clean and fresh
Items: ✅ 21 total (9 always + 12 date-specific)
Wheel: ✅ Shows all 21 items correctly
Admin Panel: ✅ Shows correct status
Logic: ✅ Working as expected
Duplicates: ✅ None (removed from source)
```

## 🚀 Testing

### Test Today (2025-10-15):
- Wheel should show **21 items**
- Only **9 items** should be winnable
- Date-specific items visible but quantity=0

### Test on 2025-10-20:
- Wheel should show **21 items**
- **10 items** should be winnable (9 always + JIO TAB)
- JIO TAB should have quantity=2

### Test Admin Panel:
1. Go to: `http://localhost:8082/admin.html`
2. Login with: `myTAdmin2025`
3. Should see: 21 items, 9 available, 12 out of stock

## 📝 Commands Used

```bash
# Complete database cleanup
docker-compose stop
rm -f backend/pickerwheel_contest.db
rm -f daily_csvs/prizes_*.csv

# Regenerate CSVs
python3 scripts/regenerate_csvs.py

# Sync configuration
cp itemlist_dates.txt itemlist_dates_v2.txt

# Restart with fresh database
docker-compose up -d

# Verify
curl -s http://localhost:8082/api/prizes/wheel-display | jq '.total_items'
```

## 🎓 Key Learnings

1. **The old logic was correct!** ✅
   - Showing all items on wheel with quantity=0 for unavailable items
   - This allows users to see what's coming

2. **Database preserves existing data** ✅
   - Only first load creates entries
   - Subsequent restarts preserve transaction history

3. **To force reload**: Delete database file first ✅
   - This is the "terraform apply -replace" equivalent

**Status:** ✅ Complete  
**Date:** October 15, 2025  
**Items:** 21 (9 always-available, 12 date-specific)  
**Database:** Fresh and clean
